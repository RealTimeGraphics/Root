The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the STM 'STM32F100RB' 
microcontroller using ST STM32-Discovery Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL        =  8 MHz
   - HCLK        = 24 MHz

Example functionality:                                                   
This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  STM32F100RB RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                     (used for target debugging)
  STM32F100RB Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                     (used for production or target debugging)
